   - Users provide input through an interactive interface.
2. **Frontend (HTML/CSS/JS):**
   - The input is captured through a web-based user interface.
3. **Backend (Flask App):**
   - The Flask application processes requests and manages AI model interactions.
4. **Web Scraping:**
   - The bot scrapes Amazon's website in real-time to retrieve product information.
5. **Multimodal Processing:**
   - Handles text, voice inputs to ensure robust interaction.
6. **Semantic Search with Embeddings:**
   - Converts user queries and product data into embeddings using OpenAI models.
   - Allows the bot to understand user intent and provide more relevant responses.
7. **AI Model (OpenAI):**
   - Processes queries to provide intelligent responses.
8. **Vector Store (AstraDB):**
   - Stores and retrieves product data for faster responses.
9. **Response to User:**
   - The bot returns a response in text or audio format, providing product links, descriptions, and recommendations.
